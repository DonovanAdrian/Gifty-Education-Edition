## Welcome!
This an updated version of Gifty that includes helpful 
comments in the case that other programmers want to 
learn from my mistakes and updates! Each page will detail 
what each function does and why I put it there. If you have 
any additional questions, send me an email at my support 
email!


## Who Is This "Education Edition" For?
Good question! As I look through many of the pages that I 
have already added my "helpful comments" to, I have to note 
that many of my comments require having the knowledge and 
skills to see what I'm doing with all of the data that I 
have organized. Perhaps at some point I will draw up a more 
serious diagram of how data flows through the system in light
of this.


## Do You Have Any Other Plans For This Program?
At this time, I am in the process of editing each page to 
include the aforementioned helpful comments. Once I have 
completed updating each page here, I will update each page 
as it is updated on the official Gifty repository. Apart from 
that, I do not have any additional plans at this time.
