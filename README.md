## Welcome!
This an updated version of Gifty that includes helpful 
comments in the case that other programmers want to 
learn from my mistakes and updates! Each page will detail 
what each function does and why I put it there. If you have 
any additional questions, send me an email at my support 
email!


## How Well Does This Work?
While the original Gifty is far from perfect, I have been 
able to bring it up to full functionality over the past 
couple months! Some of the updates from the old version 
include more efficient data usage, faster page loading, 
data error correction, and more reliable database 
interactions. If you are interested in looking at the full 
project that does *not* comments, take a look at my 
repositories!


## Do You Have Any Other Plans For This Program?
At this time, I am in the process of editing each page to 
include the aforementioned helpful comments. Once I have 
completed updating each page here, I will update each page 
as it is updated on the official Gifty repository. Apart from 
that, I do not have any additional plans at this time.
