# Gifty: Education Edition
> made by Donovan Adrian in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS


## ***Why Did This Get Archived?***
I personally didn't feel like this was all that helpful 
of a repository to maintain, as all of the helpful 
comments that I added to each page were extremely general, 
and really only provided a surface-level description for 
each repository. As a result, I'm not interested in 
continuing to update this repository, but I will retain 
it's visibility on Github in case it is useful for others 
to review. It should be noted that due to it's current 
state, it's only on Gifty 1.1, so much of it's data is 
long since "obsolete".

## Welcome!
This an updated version of Gifty that includes helpful 
comments in the case that other programmers want to 
learn from my mistakes and updates! Each page will detail 
what each function does and why I put it there. If you have 
any additional questions, send me an email at my support 
email!


## Who Is This "Education Edition" For?
Good question! As I look through many of the pages that I 
have already added my "helpful comments" to, I have to note 
that many of my comments require having the knowledge and 
skills to see what I'm doing with all of the data that I 
have organized. Perhaps at some point I will draw up a more 
serious diagram of how data flows through the system in light
of this.
